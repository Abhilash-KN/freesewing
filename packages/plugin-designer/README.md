## About
Freesewing generates patterns in SVG. They do not include any styling, so to make your patterns look pretty, you're going to need a theme.

The default theme that ships with [the freesewing library](https://github.com/freesewing/freesewing) styles patterns for print and online viewing.

This designer theme is no replacement for that, but rather adds information to your pattern
that will facilitate your work as a pattern designer.
