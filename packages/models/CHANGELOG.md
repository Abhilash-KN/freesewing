# Change log for: @freesewing/models


## Unreleased

**Note:** Version bump only for package models


## 2.0.1 (2019-09-01)

### Added

 - Expanded the size ranges available.
 - Added the `withBreasts` models which were missing in earlier releases.

### Changed

 - The models data is now based on the data from the `neckstimate` method in the utils package.


## 2.0.0 (2019-08-25)

This is the **initial release**, and the start of this change log.

Prior to version 2, FreeSewing was not a JavaScript project.
As such, that history is out of scope for this change log.
